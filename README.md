# Data MASH - CKD Watchers Project
This project was developed as part of European Healthcare Hackathon challenge. 
We have processed data from 4 different data sources bmi, sex, laboratory tests and diagnosis from years 2015 and 2022. Our aim was to predict the CKD. Due to commonly known fact that this disease is very often not diagnosed we decided to train our model to predict eGFR score which is commonly used test for this disease. We have implemented catboost algorithm and used shap values to discover feature importances. Model features were preselected with catboost library feature selection algorithm.
The model results were then enriched with allert of commonly known caused on which we want to always give recommendation to the doctor that they should send the patient for scoring. 
The following architecture was then used:

If we followup with our model to production, following two architectures would be applicable for private general practitioners and hospitals:

Crutial part of our solution is the resulting educative report which is personalized for each patient. This should lead to increase in GPs knowledge of risks of this disease and more trust in recommendations generated by AI algorithm.
